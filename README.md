# 🚀 Python for Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository! I am currently building a strong foundation in Python, transitioning my core Object-Oriented Programming skills from **Java to Python**. This is part of my 6-month intensive roadmap to becoming a Machine Learning Engineer.

This repository serves as my daily code journal and a central toolkit where I document my progress, practice algorithms, and write clean, efficient code.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### 1. `Fundamentals of Python/`
This folder contains my Jupyter Notebooks covering all core Python concepts required for Data Science and ML:
* **Data Structures:** Lists (with memory management concepts), Tuples, Sets, and Strings.
* **Control Flow:** `if-else` conditions, `For` & `While` loops, Nested loops, and Loop control statements.
* **Advanced Python:** List Comprehensions, Modules, and Operators.
* **Practice Sets:** Sequence sum and string manipulation exercises.

### ⏳ Upcoming Modules:
* `NumPy_Practice/` (Arrays, Matrices, and Mathematical Operations)
* `Pandas_Analysis/` (Data manipulation and CSV handling)
* `Matplotlib_Visuals/` (Data Visualization)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **Language:** Python 3.x 
* **Environment:** PyCharm / Jupyter Notebook
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

## 🎯 My Goal
To master Data Science/ML concepts and build end-to-end, real-world Machine Learning Web Applications within the next 6 months.
